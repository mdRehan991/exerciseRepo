# Counter App Using Hooks

In this app, I created two functional components one is Parent component(TestParentHooks) and other one is Child component(TestChildHooks). Here, Child component only render the counter value which it recieved as a "prop" from Parent Component. And Parent component have a state (using useState() method), which increase counter value by 1, every time I press the "Press Me" button and send this value as a "prop" to child component.
