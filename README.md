2. On Click of Signup user will navigate to Home screen and details user details like name, email and phone should be saved as a JSON string 
in AsyncStorage which will be later used in home screen.  

3. Home Screen : User's Name and Email will be displayed on the home screen  and there will be one Logout icon on the right of the header.
